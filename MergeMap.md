`mergeMap` is a powerful RxJS operator that transforms the values emitted by an observable into inner observables and merges them into a single output observable. It subscribes to each inner observable and emits their values as soon as they are available, without waiting for other inner observables to complete.

The syntax of `mergeMap` is as follows:

```typescript
sourceObservable.pipe(
  mergeMap((value: any) => innerObservable)
);
```

Here's an in-depth explanation of `mergeMap` with an example:

Consider the following scenario: You have an observable that emits a stream of user IDs, and you want to make an HTTP request to fetch user details for each user ID. You can use `mergeMap` to perform the HTTP requests concurrently and merge the responses into a single stream of user details.

```typescript
import { from, of } from 'rxjs';
import { mergeMap, delay } from 'rxjs/operators';

// Simulate an observable that emits user IDs
const userIdsObservable = from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

// Simulate a function that fetches user details from an API based on user ID
const fetchUserDetails = (userId: number) =>
  of({ id: userId, name: `User ${userId}`, email: `user${userId}@example.com` }).pipe(delay(1000));

// Use mergeMap to fetch user details for each user ID
userIdsObservable
  .pipe(
    mergeMap((userId: number) => fetchUserDetails(userId))
  )
  .subscribe((userDetails) => console.log(userDetails));
```

Output:

```
{ id: 1, name: 'User 1', email: 'user1@example.com' }
{ id: 2, name: 'User 2', email: 'user2@example.com' }
{ id: 3, name: 'User 3', email: 'user3@example.com' }
{ id: 4, name: 'User 4', email: 'user4@example.com' }
{ id: 5, name: 'User 5', email: 'user5@example.com' }
```

In this example, we have an observable `userIdsObservable` that emits user IDs `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. We also have a function `fetchUserDetails` that returns an observable containing user details for a given user ID. We use `of` to create an observable with mock user details and `delay` to simulate an asynchronous HTTP request.

The `mergeMap` operator is then used to transform each emitted user ID into an inner observable (`fetchUserDetails(userId)`). `mergeMap` subscribes to each inner observable and merges their emitted values into a single output observable. The result is a stream of user details that are fetched concurrently for each user ID.

The output shows the user details for each user ID, which were fetched and emitted by the `mergeMap` operator.

In summary, `mergeMap` is an essential operator for handling scenarios where you need to perform multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently and merge the results into a single stream. It's widely used in handling HTTP requests, handling nested observables, and any scenario where you need to flatten and merge observables into a single stream of values.
