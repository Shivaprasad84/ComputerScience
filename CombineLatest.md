`combineLatest` is an RxJS operator that combines the latest values from multiple observables into an array or object. It emits a new value whenever any of the source observables emit a value, combining the latest values from all the source observables at that moment.

The syntax of `combineLatest` is as follows:

```typescript
import { combineLatest } from 'rxjs';

combineLatest(observable1, observable2, ..., (valuesFromObs1, valuesFromObs2, ...) => result);
```

Here's an in-depth explanation of `combineLatest` with an example:

Consider the following scenario: You have two observables, one that emits a stream of user names and another that emits a stream of user scores. You want to combine the latest user name and user score into an object whenever either of the observables emits a new value.

```typescript
import { interval } from 'rxjs';
import { combineLatest } from 'rxjs';

// Simulate an observable that emits user names
const userNamesObservable = interval(1000).pipe(map((value) => `User${value}`));

// Simulate an observable that emits user scores
const userScoresObservable = interval(1500).pipe(map((value) => value * 10));

// Combine the latest user name and user score into an object
combineLatest(userNamesObservable, userScoresObservable).subscribe(([userName, userScore]) => {
  const user = { name: userName, score: userScore };
  console.log(user);
});
```

Output:

```
{ name: 'User0', score: 0 }
{ name: 'User0', score: 0 }
{ name: 'User1', score: 0 }
{ name: 'User1', score: 10 }
{ name: 'User2', score: 10 }
{ name: 'User2', score: 20 }
...
```

In this example, we have two observables: `userNamesObservable` and `userScoresObservable`.

- `userNamesObservable` emits a stream of user names every second with the pattern "User0", "User1", "User2", and so on.
- `userScoresObservable` emits a stream of user scores every 1.5 seconds with the pattern 0, 10, 20, 30, and so on (multiples of 10).

The `combineLatest` operator combines the latest values from both observables whenever any of the observables emits a new value. It emits an array containing the latest user name and user score. The `subscribe` function then creates a user object with the combined values and logs it to the console.

As a result, the output shows the combined user name and user score objects as they are emitted by the `combineLatest` operator.

It's important to note that `combineLatest` will only emit a value when all source observables have emitted at least one value. After that, it will emit a new value whenever any of the source observables emits a new value.

In summary, `combineLatest` is useful when you need to combine the latest values from multiple observables into a single output based on the latest values from all the source observables. It's commonly used for scenarios where you want to synchronize and react to changes in multiple streams of data.
