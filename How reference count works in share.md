Let's delve into how the reference count works in the `share` operator.

The `share` operator is used to convert a hot observable into a shared observable. It ensures that the observable chain remains active as long as there are active subscribers. When the last subscriber unsubscribes, the observable chain is torn down and unsubscribes from its source.

Here's how the reference count mechanism works step-by-step:

1. When the first subscriber subscribes to the shared observable, the `share` operator starts the execution of the observable chain by subscribing to the source observable. This effectively activates the observable chain.

2. As the subsequent subscribers subscribe to the shared observable, the `share` operator does not re-subscribe to the source observable. Instead, it keeps track of the total number of active subscribers using a reference count.

3. The reference count is incremented each time a new subscriber subscribes to the shared observable.

4. When a subscriber unsubscribes from the shared observable, the reference count is decremented.

5. If the reference count becomes zero (i.e., there are no more active subscribers), the `share` operator unsubscribes from the source observable, effectively tearing down the observable chain.

The reference count is the key mechanism that allows multiple subscribers to share the same execution and data stream of the source observable without creating separate instances of the observable chain for each subscriber.

Let's illustrate the reference count behavior with an example:

```typescript
import { interval } from 'rxjs';
import { share } from 'rxjs/operators';

const sourceObservable = interval(1000).pipe(share());

// First subscriber
const subscriber1 = sourceObservable.subscribe((value) => {
  console.log('Subscriber 1:', value);
});

// Second subscriber
const subscriber2 = sourceObservable.subscribe((value) => {
  console.log('Subscriber 2:', value);
});

// After some time...

// Unsubscribe the first subscriber
subscriber1.unsubscribe();

// Third subscriber (late subscriber)
setTimeout(() => {
  const subscriber3 = sourceObservable.subscribe((value) => {
    console.log('Subscriber 3 (late):', value);
  });

  // After some time...

  // Unsubscribe the second subscriber
  subscriber2.unsubscribe();

  // Unsubscribe the third subscriber
  subscriber3.unsubscribe();
}, 4000);
```

Output:

```
Subscriber 1: 0
Subscriber 2: 0
Subscriber 1: 1
Subscriber 2: 1
Subscriber 1: 2
Subscriber 2: 2
Subscriber 3 (late): 2
Subscriber 1: 3
Subscriber 2: 3
Subscriber 3 (late): 3
Subscriber 2: 4
Subscriber 3 (late): 4
Subscriber 2: 5
Subscriber 3 (late): 5
```

In this example, we create a shared observable using `share()` on an `interval` observable. Both Subscriber 1 and Subscriber 2 share the same execution and data stream. When Subscriber 1 unsubscribes after some time, the reference count decreases by one. Then, when Subscriber 2 unsubscribes, the reference count becomes zero, and the shared observable unsubscribes from the source `interval` observable, stopping the emission of values.

Later, when Subscriber 3 subscribes, it becomes a late subscriber. The shared observable is still active because the reference count is greater than zero, so Subscriber 3 receives the latest value (2) and subsequent values.
