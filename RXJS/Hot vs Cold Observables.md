Hot and cold observables are concepts in RxJS that refer to how observables produce and distribute values to subscribers. Understanding the difference between hot and cold observables is crucial for effectively working with RxJS.

1. Cold Observables:
   - A cold observable is a type of observable where each subscription creates a separate execution of the observable stream for each subscriber.
   - When you subscribe to a cold observable, it starts emitting values from the beginning of the sequence for each new subscriber, regardless of when previous subscribers started receiving values.
   - Cold observables are "lazy" in the sense that they don't produce values until someone subscribes to them.
   - Examples of cold observables include most of the observable creation functions like `of`, `from`, `interval`, etc.

Example of a cold observable:

```typescript
import { of } from 'rxjs';

const coldObservable = of(1, 2, 3);

coldObservable.subscribe((value) => console.log('Subscriber 1:', value));

// After some time...
coldObservable.subscribe((value) => console.log('Subscriber 2:', value));
```

Output:

```
Subscriber 1: 1
Subscriber 1: 2
Subscriber 1: 3

Subscriber 2: 1
Subscriber 2: 2
Subscriber 2: 3
```

In this example, both subscribers receive the entire sequence of values starting from the beginning.

2. Hot Observables:
   - A hot observable is a type of observable where values are emitted regardless of whether there are active subscribers or not.
   - When you subscribe to a hot observable, you start receiving values from the point in time when you subscribe, and you might miss values that were emitted before your subscription.
   - Hot observables are typically used for sources of events or data that are continuously happening, such as mouse clicks, keypresses, or WebSocket streams.

Example of a hot observable:

```typescript
import { Subject } from 'rxjs';

const hotObservable = new Subject<number>();

hotObservable.subscribe((value) => console.log('Subscriber 1:', value));

hotObservable.next(1);
hotObservable.next(2);
hotObservable.next(3);

// After some time...
hotObservable.subscribe((value) => console.log('Subscriber 2:', value));

hotObservable.next(4);
hotObservable.next(5);
```

Output:

```
Subscriber 1: 1
Subscriber 1: 2
Subscriber 1: 3
Subscriber 2: 4
Subscriber 2: 5
```

In this example, Subscriber 1 receives values starting from the beginning, while Subscriber 2 only receives values emitted after its subscription.

Tricks to Identify Hot vs. Cold Observables:
Here are some tricks to identify whether a particular observable is hot or cold:

1. Hot Observables often involve event sources like mouse events, keypresses, or WebSocket streams. If you're dealing with real-time event streams, it's likely a hot observable.

2. Cold Observables are often created using observable creation functions like `of`, `from`, `interval`, or by transforming other observables using operators like `map`, `filter`, etc.

3. Hot Observables might be created explicitly using `Subject`, `BehaviorSubject`, `ReplaySubject`, or other custom subjects.

4. If an observable is produced by a shared source (e.g., a shared network request), it's more likely to be hot.

Remember that identifying whether an observable is hot or cold can help you understand how it behaves and whether you need to apply techniques like multicasting (using `share`, `publish`, etc.) to handle hot observables effectively.
