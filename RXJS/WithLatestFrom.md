`withLatestFrom` is an RxJS operator that allows you to combine the latest value from the source observable with the latest values from one or more other observables. It emits a new value whenever the source observable emits a value, combined with the latest values from the other observables.

The syntax of `withLatestFrom` is as follows:

```typescript
import { withLatestFrom } from 'rxjs/operators';

sourceObservable.pipe(
  withLatestFrom(otherObservable1, otherObservable2, ..., (sourceValue, valueFromObs1, valueFromObs2, ...) => result)
);
```

Here's an in-depth explanation of `withLatestFrom` with an example:

Consider the following scenario: You have two observables, one that emits a stream of user names and another that emits a stream of user scores. You want to combine the latest user name with the latest user score whenever the user score observable emits a new value.

```typescript
import { interval } from 'rxjs';
import { withLatestFrom } from 'rxjs/operators';

// Simulate an observable that emits user names
const userNamesObservable = interval(1000).pipe(map((value) => `User${value}`));

// Simulate an observable that emits user scores
const userScoresObservable = interval(1500).pipe(map((value) => value * 10));

// Combine the latest user name with the latest user score
userScoresObservable
  .pipe(
    withLatestFrom(userNamesObservable),
    map(([userScore, userName]) => ({ name: userName, score: userScore }))
  )
  .subscribe((user) => {
    console.log(user);
  });
```

Output:

```
{ name: 'User0', score: 0 }
{ name: 'User1', score: 10 }
{ name: 'User2', score: 20 }
{ name: 'User3', score: 30 }
{ name: 'User4', score: 40 }
...
```

In this example, we have two observables: `userNamesObservable` and `userScoresObservable`.

- `userNamesObservable` emits a stream of user names every second with the pattern "User0", "User1", "User2", and so on.
- `userScoresObservable` emits a stream of user scores every 1.5 seconds with the pattern 0, 10, 20, 30, and so on (multiples of 10).

The `withLatestFrom` operator is used with `userScoresObservable`, and it takes `userNamesObservable` as its argument. This means that whenever `userScoresObservable` emits a new value, `withLatestFrom` will combine the latest value from `userScoresObservable` with the latest value from `userNamesObservable`.

The `map` operator is then used to create a user object with the combined user name and user score, and it emits this object downstream.

As a result, the output shows the combined user name and user score objects as they are emitted by the `withLatestFrom` operator whenever `userScoresObservable` emits a new value.

In summary, `withLatestFrom` is useful when you want to combine the latest value from the source observable with the latest values from one or more other observables. It's commonly used for scenarios where you need to react to changes in one observable based on the latest values from other observables.
