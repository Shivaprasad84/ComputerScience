You are correct that hot observables, by nature, share the same execution and data stream among multiple subscribers. The statement in the first sentence might seem confusing because it implies that hot observables need to be transformed into shared observables using `share` and `shareReplay`. Let's clarify the reason behind using these operators with hot observables:

1. Hot Observables and Sharing:
   - Hot observables, as standalone observables, indeed share the same execution and data stream among multiple subscribers. When you create a hot observable using subjects or any other means, all subscribers share the same source of data and receive values independently from the point they subscribe.
   - For example, if you have a hot observable created using a `Subject`, all subscribers to that `Subject` will receive the same values from the source that the `Subject` emits.

2. Purpose of `share` and `shareReplay` with Hot Observables:
   - The `share` and `shareReplay` operators are useful in scenarios where you want to multicast a hot observable, ensuring that late subscribers receive the same data as subscribers who joined earlier. This is particularly useful when you have long-lived or late subscribers that you want to provide with access to the same data stream.
   - By applying the `share` operator to a hot observable, you effectively transform it into a shared observable that maintains a reference count. The observable chain is executed when the first subscriber subscribes, and multiple subscribers share the same execution.
   - Similarly, the `shareReplay` operator caches a specified number of past values and "replays" them to new subscribers, ensuring that late subscribers receive a certain number of past values in addition to the latest value.
   - The main advantage of using `share` and `shareReplay` with hot observables is that you can easily control how data is shared among subscribers, especially when you want to multicast the data to late or long-lived subscribers, while also avoiding unnecessary re-execution of the observable chain for each subscriber.

In summary, the reason for using `share` and `shareReplay` with hot observables is to provide fine-grained control over how data is shared among subscribers and to avoid redundant execution of the observable chain. These operators are particularly useful when you want to multicast data to late subscribers, ensuring they receive the same data as subscribers who joined earlier.

so does that mean using share and shareReplay we convert a hot observable into a cold one?
